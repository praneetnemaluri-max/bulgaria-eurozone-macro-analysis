# Bulgaria Eurozone Macro Analysis (2000–2010)

This project is an end-to-end macroeconomic analysis of Bulgaria’s economy from 2000 to 2010, focused on EU accession (2007) and the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. It evaluates how **real GDP growth**, **unemployment**, and **inflation** evolved, and what that implies for Bulgaria’s risk–return profile as an EU member.

The final deliverable is an **investment-style report** written for business and finance stakeholders rather than as a school assignment.

## Objectives

- Analyse Bulgaria’s macroeconomic performance before and after EU accession.
- Quantify trends in real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation.

- Provide sector-specific **investment recommendations** and risk mitigation strategies.
