# Bulgaria Eurozone Macro Analysis (2000–2010)

How did Bulgaria’s economy behave around EU accession and the 2008–2009 financial crisis, and what would that mean for an investor looking at the country today?

This project walks through that question step by step, using real macro data and ending in an investor‑style report.

## 1. Project at a glance

**Goal:**  
Understand Bulgaria’s **growth, jobs and inflation** story from 2000–2010 and turn it into clear business insights for long‑term investors.

**Core idea (flow):**

Data ➜ Clean & structure ➜ Explore in SQL/Excel ➜ Visualise in Power BI ➜ Write investment report

## 2. Flow of the analysis

1. **Collect**
   - GDP, unemployment and inflation data for Bulgaria (2000–2010)
   - Sources: World Bank, IMF, Bulgarian National Statistical Institute

2. **Prepare**
   - Clean and reshape the data into analysis‑ready tables
   - Standardise years, formats and indicator names

3. **Analyse**
   - Use SQL + Excel to:
     - Compare pre‑ vs post‑EU accession periods
     - Quantify the 2009 crisis impact
     - Measure volatility across indicators

4. **Visualise**
   - Build three key Power BI views:
     - Real GDP growth
     - Unemployment rate
     - Inflation rate

5. **Conclude**
   - Summarise findings in a structured, investor‑style PDF:
     - Market strengths and weaknesses
     - Sector opportunities
     - Risk–return profile and time horizon

## 4. Key takeaways (human, not just numbers)

- Bulgaria grows fast in good times but is sensitive to global shocks – especially around 2009.  
- Unemployment improves a lot pre‑accession, then jumps when the crisis hits.  
- Inflation spikes during the commodity boom, despite the currency board, before settling back down.  
- Overall, Bulgaria looks like a **moderate‑risk, moderate‑to‑high return** market for patient investors with a multi‑year horizon.

## 5. How to explore this project

- **Skim the story:** open the PDF in `REPORT/` to read the investment‑style narrative.  
- **Check the logic:** review the SQL scripts in `SQL/` to see how the data was shaped.  
- **Play with the data:** open the Power BI file in `POWERBI/` to interact with the charts.  
- **Dive into raw numbers:** use the CSV/Excel files in `DATA/` for your own slices and checks.
